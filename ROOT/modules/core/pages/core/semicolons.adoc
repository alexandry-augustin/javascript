Best Practices

Always use semicolons: This is the safest and most widely adopted convention. It makes your code more robust, readable, and less prone to errors.

Use a linter: Tools like ESLint can enforce a consistent semicolon convention and catch potential issues, regardless of the style you choose.

Be aware of ASI: Even if you use semicolons, it's helpful to understand how ASI works to debug code that might be missing them.

return 1;

let i = 0;
do {
  i++;

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // ...

----
import { a } from './module.js';
export default a;

Although blocks are delimited by curly braces `{}`, you might sometimes see a semicolon after a block. 
This is not required by the block syntax itself but might be necessary if the block is part of a larger statement, like an `if`-`else` or `do`-`while` statement.

[,javascript]
----
if (condition) {
  // block 1
} else {
  // block 2
}; // This semicolon is not required by the block itself

== Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)

[,Gemini]
____
ASI will automatically insert a semicolon after "return, throw, break, and continue" keywords if they are followed by a line break. This can cause the statement to be terminated prematurely, leading to an unexpected result.

// Incorrect (returns `undefined` because of ASI)
function getObject() {
  return
  {
    name: 'object'
  };
}

// Correct
function getObject() {
  return {
    name: 'object'
  };
}
